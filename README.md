# Inverse-Projection-Mapping

An implementation of Inverse Projection Mapping using some OpenCV magic.

With Inverse Projection Mapping, depth perception becomes much easier for humans and image processing algorithms. Raw images, as shown on the left, need to be transformed into a "birds eye view" as shown on the right.
